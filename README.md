# Polling

When polling you do not have to use Jerry-Bot's name. Instead make sure you start your command with `!poll` or `/poll`

## Making a Poll

When you trigger Jerry, they will react to your poll with all of the emoji options to make it easier for people to join in on your poll.

Start by typing `!poll` or `/poll` followed by your question. Jerry will automatically react with a positive and negative emoji. If you want to supply options, every subsequent line should start with an emoji option.

Note: Please make sure all emojis you use are available in the current server.
